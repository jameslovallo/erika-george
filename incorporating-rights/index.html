      Human rights have not been a central concern of corporate law. Corporate
      actors have not been a central concern of international human rights law.
      This book examines existing and emerging strategies that could conceivably
      close a global governance gap that places human rights at risk and puts
      commercial actors in the position of becoming complicit in human rights
      abuses or implicated in abuses when conducting business in emerging market
      economies or other complex environments. Corporate codes of conduct,
      sustainability reporting, and selected multi-stakeholder initiatives are
      presented as the building blocks of a system of strengthening “soft law”
      that could solidify to become binding baseline standards for better
      business practices. It explains the conditions that have given rise to
      constructive change as well as those methods and mechanisms with promise
      for ensuring that business enterprises incorporate human rights
      considerations into business operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book explores how capital and consumer markets could provide an
      additional or alternative form of enforcement to promote responsible
      business conduct. It provides comparative accounts of the creation of
      industry sector specific regulatory instruments and governance
      institutions arising from allegations of corporate complicity in human
      rights abuses after conflicts with concerned constituencies and affected
      communities. It considers market- based strategies to bring business
      practices into alignment with the responsibility to respect human rights
      and examines how corporate social responsibility initiatives could close
      the governance gap and how codes of conduct could come to regulate like
      real rules. It argues that regulation through information is essential to
      ensure that corporate conduct will be informed by human rights
      considerations and that business policies and practices will be
      implemented consistent with respect for human rights.
