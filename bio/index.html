    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      My central objective is to create a classroom environment where students
      are exposed to new ideas, actively engaged in the learning process, and
      empowered to continue their education outside of my classroom. Student
      evaluations consistently commend my comprehensive knowledge of the
      subjects I teach and the respectful and inclusive learning environment I
      work to create.
