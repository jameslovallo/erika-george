    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am the Samuel D. Thurman Professor of Law and I also direct the Tanner
      Humanities Center at the University of Utah. I began my academic career at
      the Universityâ€™s S. J. Quinney College of Law. I earned my B.A. with
      honors from the University of Chicago and my J.D. from Harvard Law School,
      where I served as an Articles Editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil
      Liberties Law Review. I also hold an M.A. in International Relations from
      the University of Chicago. Prior to entering the legal academy, I was
      employed by Human Rights Watch and corporate law firms in Chicago and New
      York City. I remain inspired and motivated in both my scholarship and
      teaching by the problems I encountered during my years of human rights
      advocacy and law practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a thought leader in a growing area of inquiry at the intersection of
      human rights, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility. My
      current research focuses on the obligations of private actors under public
      international law and policy and efforts by private actors to fill gaps in
      global governance. I study the responsibility of transnational
      corporations to respect international human rights and various efforts to
      hold corporations accountable for alleged rights violations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a sought-after speaker on issues of human rights and corporate social
      responsibility, the human rights of women and children, trafficking in
      persons, equity and anti-discrimination, and environmental justice. My
      scholarship has appeared in prestigious legal journals including the
      California Law Review, the Michigan Journal of International Law, the New
      York Journal of International Law and Policy, and the Annual Proceedings
      of the American Society of International Law.

    <h2>My Research</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, my academic research seeks to better understand the role of
      private non-state actors in public international law. My research also
      explores the interdependence of civil, political, social, economic,
      cultural rights, and environmental rights. My research methodology is
      interdisciplinary. As a sociolegal scholar, I combine qualitative
      empirical and humanist research methodologies to examine the role of law
      in society. I aim to produce influential scholarship at the intersection
      of human rights, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility. My
      scholarship seeks to introduce human rights considerations into
      conversations about different issues of contemporary concern such as
      globalization and economic development, conflict and security, equity,
      technology, and environmental justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I remain committed to producing scholarship that is relevant to
      the contemporary concerns of international human rights and environmental
      movements, I serve on the advisory boards of non-governmental
      organizations that work to build a better world.
